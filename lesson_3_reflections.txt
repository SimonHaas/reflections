When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  	When you work collaborative with other people and everyone wants to commit or 
  	you want to work from various places so you have your project in a cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because someone pushes something to GitHub that I do not want to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks a kinda clones on the GitHub servers. You clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine. 
	You create a branch when you want to remain several versins of your code.
