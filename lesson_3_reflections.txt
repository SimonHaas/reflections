When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  	When you work collaborative with other people and everyone wants to commit or 
  	you want to work from various places so you have your project in a cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because someone pushes something to GitHub that I do not want to pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks a kinda clones on the GitHub servers. You clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine. 
	You create a branch when you want to remain several versins of your code. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If the remote gets deleted you will not lose the most advanced state of your project.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	It would be very hard to share the code via email once you made a significant change. An easier way would be 
	to share your code via dropbox.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When making changes in the master branche you do not have to deal with merging and so on but it is more risky 
	due to breaking the funktionalitie of your master branch.
