What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a hidden directory to store commits and the information it needs.
	I need to do this in order to be able to use git on this folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	In the staging area are the files which are going to be commited. It gives you 
	the advantage of now having to save every single file. Maybe media resources 
	in an android app don't have to be saved because the will never change. So 
	by not saving these you can save a lot of storrage.
